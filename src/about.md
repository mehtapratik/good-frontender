<p class="salutation">Hello &amp; Welcome!</p>
<h1 class="intro">
  <span class="who-am-i">I&rsquo;m Pratik Mehta.</span>
  <span class="who-am-i-ext">An experienced web developer &amp; an enthusiast designer living and working in Princeton, NJ.</span>
</h1>

I specialize in building responsive and inclusive websites and design systems. This blog is sum of my learnings and experiences while doing just so. Recruiters and alike can find a [formal resume here](/resume).

Wondering about the domain name, Good Frontender? Well, mehtapratik.com and pratikmehta.com were taken. So, I came up with this domain name after the names of many TV shows and phrases: Good Place, Good Doctor, Good Wife, Good Omen, Good Shepherd, Good Behavior, Good Samaritan & Goodreads &ndash; pun intended.

This site built using [11ty](//11ty.dev) and hosted on [Netlify](//netlify.com); sourcecode it can be found at [GitHub](//github.com/mehtapratik/good-frontender).
