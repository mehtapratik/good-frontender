title: College Preparation Checklist
blurb: A quick rundown of things to consider while preparing for college during your high school years.
---

1. Keep it simple. Reply on school counselors instead of spending money for in college prep consulting. Don’t be a helicopter parent.
2. Start prepping for SAT/ACT starting from middle school. Scores of these act as general filter criteria but they are not final decision criteria.
3. Create 4 year plan of courses (APs) you want to take. Plan in such a way that you fulfill the prerequisite course first. Course info and dependencies may be available on your school website too. Talk to your school counselor if you need help.
4. Two things that matter the most for college admission: number courses (APs) you take and your weighted GPA. Top school expected around 8-13 APs. Take as many honors and APs your child can handle.
5. If your child is willing and has capacity, take option II courses during summer breaks which will help them attend advance courses in school. Result of these courses do not count in GPA, though.
6. Build a rapport with your school teachers and counselors. You will need 3 letter of recommendation from teachers and 1 from counselor.
7. Participate in 1-2 school club/competition that you are passionate and interested about. Don’t try to do all. Try to lead a club,if you’re willing and has capacity. You can even think of a new club and request to form one and act as a president.
8. Use Naviance from 11th grade to research on possible colleges to apply. You will be able to see your weighted GPA vs. historical admission record against it. You are in good spot as long as you’re in 75-90 percentile.
9. Shortlist 12-15 colleges to apply. Some difficult, some likely and some easy to get in.
10. Read up more on early action and early decision, if you’re interested.
